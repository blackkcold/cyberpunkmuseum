                        This website, Cyberpunk Orientalism Research Centre or CORC ( below), focuses on the
                        presentation of cyberpunk, Orientalism and techno-orientalism images, inspired by my previous
                        research. There is a lack of scholarly and public understanding of the cultural transmission and
                        image construction of this popular culture, especially in terms of relevant research (Roh, Huang
                        and Niu, 2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website will provide as complete a path as possible to show how Orientalism has transformed
                        within the cyberpunk cultural genre, and how it has been inherited and changed into
                        Techno-Orientalism.

                        <h5>what is cyberpunk</h5>
                        <p>
                            Since the science fiction movement in the 1980s, Cyberpunk has been recognized and prevalent
                            in the public as a distinct genre with a unique aesthetic. With outstanding leaders such as
                            William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, and the synchronous prevalence of computer technology and
                            the internet, Cyberpunk has continued its significant influence on modern literature,
                            aesthetic, and culture in areas such as anime, film, games and design (Tatsumi, 2018).
                            Cyberpunk convergent culture and concern with technology has become familiar to the global
                            audience and the transcultural characteristics and dynamic meaning of Cyberpunk are embedded
                            in the process.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-c concept-acb">
                    <div class="text-concept-acb">
                        <h5>what is orientalism</h5>
                        <p>
                            During the research into Cyberpunk, it was found that in the sphere of influential media
                            contents, Cyberpunk has polarized or imbalanced the gaps between the East and the West, with
                            the representative characteristics of Orientalism and a new framework for the new period of
                            techno-orientalism (Sanders, 2008). Thus, Roh, Huang and Niu (2015) mentioned that, in the
                            mid-1990s, Morley and Robins, Ueno, and Sato contributed critiques and views to the freshly
                            conceived ‘techno-orientalism’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, in fact, Cyberpunk films not only include the east, but also merge the oriental
                            elements into the narrative and scenes of films, in which part of these eastern images has
                            shaped the orientalism of Cyberpunk (Park, 2004). The Cyberpunk productions of the US have
                            built a high-tech Japan in the background of story, which is pointed out as a ‘default
                            setting for the future’, constructing a techno-Japanism (Taillandier, 2018). Posadas (2017)
                            suggests that ‘Japan’, in other words, is reconstructed in a process of being over coded and
                            determined in the repeating shape of the narrative, which has led to the imagined Japanese
                            images and imagined position of it into a complicated and critical place. Not only the
                            rebuilt Japanese images, but the distortion of these images have also extended into the
                            larger term of ‘Asia’, which provides times-associated dynamic eastern images within a
                            multiple speculative vision of the imaged future (Roh, Huang and Niu, 2015). Stephen Hong
                            Sohn (cited in Fan, 2015) calls this, the ‘re-articulation and re-emergence of the yellow
                            peril’ and it has appeared as a historical variation in the more modern techno-orientalism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            the review of Orientalism and techno-orientalism in cyberpunk in different periods can help
                            distinguish the different characteristics of the changes in techno-orientalism and support
                            the study of the inevitable changes in east-West relations brought about by the economic
                            rise of Asia. In this case, Cyberpunk is not only constructing a current world extension via
                            textual or visual form, but it also presents an aesthetic were eastern atmosphere and
                            orientalism takes on an important position, which is uncommon in other types of production
                            (Fan, 2015).
